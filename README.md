## Introduction
Text summarization is a fundamental task in NLP, with applications ranging from news summarization to document summarization.
This project aims to explore three different approaches to text summarization and provide implementations to demonstrate their effectiveness.

## Approaches
1. **TF-IDF Summarization**:
This approach uses the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique to extract the most important sentences from a text based on their frequency and relevance.
2. **Hugging Face Model**:
Leveraging models available through Hugging Face's Transformers library, this approach employs state-of-the-art pre-trained models fine-tuned specifically for text summarization tasks.
3. **OpenAI API**:
Utilizing the OpenAI API, this approach leverages cutting-edge language models to generate coherent and concise summaries from input text.

## Usage  
To use any of the summarization approaches implemented in this project, follow the instructions provided in each approach's respective directory.  
1. **TF-IDF Summarization**:
- Navigate to the `tfidf_summarization` directory.
- Follow the instructions provided in the README file within that directory.
2. **Hugging Face Model**:
- Navigate to the `huggingface_summarization` directory.
- Refer to the README file for instructions on setting up and using the Hugging Face model.
3. **OpenAI API**:
  - Navigate to the `openai_api_summarization` directory.
  - Follow the instructions provided in the README file to utilize the OpenAI API for text summarization.
## Dependencies  
The dependencies for each approach may vary. Please refer to the README files within each approach's directory for specific requirements and installation instructions.
